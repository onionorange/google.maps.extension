google.maps.extension
=====================
get center point between the two given point

get center point list between two point


the center point could cross the international date line(this is important)


(70, 120) and (-70, -120)  ===>   other extension will output center point (0, 0)
(70, 120) and (-70, -120)  ===>   my extension will output center point (0, 180)

On google map you will get two line, one is short, the other is long. so if you need the short line and the center points on the short line; my extension is fit for you well.


have fun!
